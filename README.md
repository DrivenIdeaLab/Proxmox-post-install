- Root access

---

## Quick Start

1. **Login as root** (`ssh root@pve-ip`) or via console.  
2. **Download or create the script:**

```bash
nano /root/install-post.sh
# Paste the script content here, then save (Ctrl+X, then Y, enter)
chmod +x /root/install-post.sh
```

3. **(Optional)** Create an `.env` file to customize features:

```bash
nano /root/xs-install-post.env
```

Sample content:

```ini
XS_NOENTREPO="yes"
XS_NOSUBBANNER="yes"
XS_APTUPGRADE="yes"
XS_FAIL2BAN="yes"
XS_AMDFIXES="yes"
XS_APTIPV4="yes"
XS_UTILS="yes"
# disable OVH RTM if not on OVH:
XS_OVHRTM="no"
```

4. **Run the script**

```bash
/root/install-post.sh
```

5. When script finishes, **REBOOT** your server:

```bash
reboot
```

Enjoy a clean, secure, optimized Proxmox!

## What this script **does NOT** do by default

- Enable enterprise or test repos  
- Set up Ceph (can be manually done after)  
- Install zfs-auto-snapshot (manual)  
- Configure PCI passthrough explicitly (VM-level)  
- Modify firewalls (uses fail2ban instead)  

Customize more as needed!

---

## Verification

After reboot, check:

- **No subscription nag** is gone  
- `pveversion -v` shows 8.3.5  
- No unconfigured packages (`dpkg -l | grep -i hold`)  
- `fail2ban-client status` shows active jails  
- `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-subscription.list` active, enterprise repo disabled  
- Tuning sysctls applied:

```bash
sysctl vm.swappiness
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
```

Expect `10` and `bbr`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Run as root user** only  
- Make sure Proxmox install is fresh/unconfigured or backed up  
- Network configuration safe with console/ILO available  
- DNS must work before/script will apt update correctly  
- If partial upgrade, reboot, re-run script once packages fix themselves

---

## How to customize further

- Fork or edit this script freely  
- Adjust `.env` vars to your needs  
- Add your branding, banners, docs  
- Add your favorite agents, backup clients, etc

Consider a private fork with internal secrets or keys not published publicly
